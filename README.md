# video_widget

This is a widget I developed for an application of mine. I ended up separating it, because it was more complex, and I decided to release it to a repository in case the need to take advantage of the component.

## TO USE

Add the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:

~~~yaml
dependencies:
  video_widget:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/fariosofernando/VideoPlayerWidget-Flutter-.git

~~~
